    <h2 id="about-me">About me:</h2>
    <p>I am 33 years old and live in Portland, Oregon. I am currently a technician, wiring control panels for mobile hydraulics systems that target large industrial and everyday needs. Prior to attending Epicodus I completed 3 years with The Art Institute of Portland before the campus closed down, pursuing a bachelors in applied sciences with a major in Industrial Design. My background ranges from 10+ years in customer service to large scale production and small scale technical manufacturing. I guess you could say that I'm adaptable and that I like a steep learning curve.</p> 
    <p>I am intrigued by the expanse of knowledge and near constant learning through problem solving that programming has to offer. My goal is to take as much as I can from this course and apply it to a career in the field where I have the opportunity to grow and surpass the teachings. I have been excited to attend every class thus far and often work for hours outside of class time, practicing, taking extensive notes, and often applying the content that I have learned. This is the start of a new chapter in my life. <span id="offset">Thank you for reading</span>.</p>

    <p id="interests"><strong>Some of my current interests / hobbies / skills include:</strong> Reading science fiction or fantasy, coding in my free time, indoor bouldering, cycling, backpacking, camping, kayaking, long distance road trips to national parks, taking care of too many houseplants, and generally learning new things. My technical background has provided me with the skills to be comfortable in most shop environments, with extensive experience with most metal and woodworking tools. I find that once I put my mind to something it's generally easy for me to develop a good understanding of the foundations required to perform the necassary tasks adequately.</p>
