    <h1>Hello, I'm Mac Granger.</h1>
    <br>
    <h2 id="about-me">About me:</h2>
    <p>I am 33 years old and I live in Portland, Oregon. I am currently a technician, wiring control panels for mobile hydraulics systems that target large industrial and everyday needs. Prior to attending Episcodus I completed 3 years with The Art Institute of Portland before the campus closed down, pursuing a bachelors in applied sciences with a major in Industrial Design. My background ranges from 10+ years in customer service to large scale production and small scale technical manufacturing. I guess you could say that I'm adaptable.</p> 
    <p>I am intrigued by the expanse of knowledge and near constant learning through problem solving that programming has to offer. My goal is to take as much as I can from this course and apply it to a career in the field where I have the opportunity to grow and surpass the teaching. I am excited to attend every class thus far and often work for hours outside of my scrum, practicing, taking extensive notes, and applying the content that I have learned. This is the start of a new chapter in my life. <span id="offset">Thank you for reading</span>.</p>
